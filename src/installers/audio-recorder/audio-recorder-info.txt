This is an audio recorder application for the GNOME 2.x/3.x and Ubuntu's 
Unity Desktops.

This program allows you to record your favourite music and audio to a file. 
It can record audio from your system's soundcard, microphones, browsers, 
webcams & more. 

Put simply; if it plays out of your loudspeakers you can record it. This 
can also record your Skype-calls automatically.

It has an advanced timer that can:

* Start, stop or pause recording at a given clock time.
* Start, stop or pause after a time period.
* Stop when the recorded file size exceeds a limit.
* Start recording on voice or sound (user can set the audio level and delay).
* Stop or pause recording on "silence" (user can set the audio level and delay).

The recording can be atomatically controlled by MPRIS2-compatible media players.
Skype. It can also record all your Skype calls without any user interaction.

This program supports several audio (output) formats such as OGG audio, Flac, 
MP3 and WAV. 

The installation is very easy. Run these commands on the command line:

    sudo apt-add-repository ppa:osmoma/audio-recorder
    sudo apt-get update

various audio-formats:

    gstreamer0.10-plugins-good (WAV and Flac formats)

Aditional guides and fixes:

If you are recording from a microphone, please check the [Input] settings in 
'gnome-volume-control'. The input volume is often too low.  Please study this

You may need to change the sound configuration on some computer systems. Please 
take a look at this picture: http://bildr.no/image/1168830.jpeg

Install & start "pavucontrol" and set the configuration to "Analog Stereo Output" 
and test the recording. This may fix the recording if you get "empty" audio files.
