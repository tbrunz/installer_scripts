#
# Firewall Knock Operator (fwknop) client rc file.
#
# This file contains user-specific fwknop client configuration default
# and named parameter sets for specific invocations of the fwknop client.
#
# Each section (or stanza) is identified and started by a line in this
# file that contains a single identifier surrounded by square brackets.
# It is this identifier (or name) that is used from the fwknop command line
# via the '-n <name>' argument to reference the corresponding stanza.
#
# The parameters within the stanza typically match corresponding client 
# command-line parameters.
#
# The first one should always be `[default]' as it defines the global
# default settings for the user. These override the program defaults
# for these parameters.  If a named stanza is used, its entries will
# override any of the default values.  Command-line options will trump them
# all.
#
# Subsequent stanzas will have only the overriding and destination
# specific parameters.
#
# Lines starting with `#' and empty lines are ignored.
#
# See the fwknop.8 man page for a complete list of valid parameters
# and their values.

# We start with the 'default' stanza.  Uncomment and edit for your
# preferences.  The client will use its built-in default for those items
# that are commented out.
