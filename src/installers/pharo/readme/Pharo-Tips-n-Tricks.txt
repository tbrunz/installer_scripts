Scaling for HiDPI in Pharo:
Evaluating "MenubarMorph reset" will fix the menu bar scaling factor.  
There's a SQUEAK_FAKEBIGCURSOR env var which you can set to 1 to have the VM 
display the cursor twice as big as normal. I've no idea why the word 'FAKE' is 
part of this; from the source it looks like it just creates a normal X11 cursor 
that's twice as big as normal. This should work with Cuis, Squeak, and Pharo, 
as it's part of the VM.
