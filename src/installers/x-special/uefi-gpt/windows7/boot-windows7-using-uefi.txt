
Installing Windows 7 in native EFI mode from USB
==========================================================================

Windows 8 users: The following procedure is unnecessary. Just copy the entire 
contents to a FAT32 USB drive and it should boot correctly in native EFI mode.

Windows 7 users: Follow the procedure below to make a Windows 7 install able 
to boot in UEFI.

To install Windows so that it will take advantage of the native UEFI firmware 
of a Sandy Bridge (or later) motherboard can be done from DVD or USB.  Booting 
the installer from the DVD will boot you straight in EFI mode as you'd expect; 
however, if you create a USB boot drive for the Windows 7 installer, the system 
will only boot in BIOS mode, and the installer will not let you install in EFI 
mode to GPT disks.

Here's what you need to do:

Requirements:

* 4GB (or larger) USB boot drive with Windows 7 64-bit installer - there are 
plenty of guides around the internet for creating one. Ensure that the drive 
correctly boots on a BIOS system.

* A copy of 'bootmgfw.efi'. You can obtain this file from an install of 64-bit 
Windows 7: Look in 'C:\Windows\Boot\EFI'. Alternatively, the file can also be 
extracted from a Windows 7 (or higher) x64 DVD. It is located in the 2.7 GByte 
large archive 'Install.wim' in the subdirectory '\sources'. The archive can be 
extracted with an archiving program. This file is located in the subdirectory 
"1" of the archive at '1\Windows\Boot\EFI\'. The correct size for the 
'bootmgfw.efi' file should be around 657 kB.

* A system with native 64-bit UEFI 2.0 firmware. This is pretty much all Sandy 
Bridge systems (except for Gigabyte motherboards) and some new laptops.

Instructions:

1.) In the root of your USB drive, find the '\efi\microsoft\boot' directory. 
Copy this directory one level up so the files also reside under '\efi\boot'.

2.) Copy the 'bootmgfw.efi' file to '\efi\boot', and rename it 'bootx64.efi'.

3.) Test the USB drive in a UEFI system. It should automatically boot with the 
UEFI method, but you may have to specifically choose UEFI boot depending on 
your system.

That's it! No need to write boot sectors or anything like that.  As long as 
you have a FAT32 filesystem with a '\efi\boot\bootx64.efi' file, the computer 
should pick that up and start booting. 

There are now two methods to verify that the installer has indeed booted in 
EFI mode:

1.) When you see the Install welcome screen, hit Shift+F10. This will open a 
command prompt. Run "notepad \Windows\Panther\setupact.log", and the log will 
show:

    Callback_BootEnvironmentDetect: Detected boot environment: BIOS
or
    Callback_BootEnvironmentDetect: Detected boot environment: UEFI

2.) Open the command prompt with Shift+F10, but this time run 'diskpart'. Use 
"list disk" to see all the disks on your computer, and type "select disk n" to 
select the disk with number 'n' that you're going to install Windows to 
(usually 1). 

Type "clean" to clear the partition table, then run "convert gpt" to create a 
GPT partition table. Once that's done, close the command prompt and start the 
install process. When prompted for the disk to install to, choose the one that 
you just created a GPT partition table on. If no yellow exclamation mark 
warning appears, the installer will install Windows in EFI mode, creating the 
necessary EFI partitions and adding the necessary bootloader entry to the EFI's 
NVRAM. Otherwise, you've booted in BIOS mode and the installer will not let 
you install to a GPT disk.

Another tip that you might find useful if the motherboard's EFI NVRAM has been 
reset somehow (perhaps you got a new board or something) or the default 
bootloader has been changed. Run

    bcdedit /set {FWbootmgr} displayorder {Bootmgr} /addfirst

either from Windows or a WinPE environment and the EFI bootloader will be set 
back to the default Windows Bootloader.

Note: If you have a USB 2.0 port, try using that. Windows 7 (unlike Windows 8) 
does NOT have any in-box drivers for USB 3.0 controllers, so that might cause 
missing driver error messages (or an inability to install from USB 3 slots).

Note: Do not use the official Windows 7 USB DVD download tool to create a 
bootable USB drive. It formats drive as NTFS and your UEFI will not recognize 
it in EFI mode. You can use 'http://sites.google.com/site/rmprepusb/' to format 
a USB drive using the FAT32 Win7 bootloader option and then manually copy files 
from the DVD. Once done, you should be able to browse the drive upon EFI boot.

Note: Converting a drive to GPT may require rebooting in order for the setup 
application to recognize the new partition format.

You can also create a USB installation flash drive with 'WintoFlash', which one 
can instruct to format the USB drive using FAT32.  (NTFS format cannot be used 
for a UEFI installation, which is why Microsoft's "Windows 7 USB/DVD download 
tool" will not work. However, since UEFI is becoming the standard, MS might, 
in time, update this tool to allow FAT32formatting).
