Automatic Install using standard Ubuntu Repository

The first method is the easiest to perform and in most cases it is the 
recommended approach.  First, detect the model of your nvidia graphic card 
and the recommended driver.  

To do so execute the following (which will take several seconds to scan your 
system, so be patient):

$ ubuntu-drivers devices
== /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/0000:01:00.0 ==
modalias : pci:v000010DEd00001180sv00001458sd0000353Cbc03sc00i00
vendor   : NVIDIA Corporation
model    : GK104 [GeForce GTX 680]
driver   : nvidia-304 - distro non-free
driver   : nvidia-340 - distro non-free
driver   : nvidia-384 - distro non-free recommended
driver   : xserver-xorg-video-nouveau - distro free builtin

== cpu-microcode.py ==
driver   : intel-microcode - distro free

From the above output we can conclude that the current system has NVIDIA 
GeForce GTX 680 graphic card installed and the recommend driver to install 
is nvidia-384.  If you agree with the recommendation feel free to use 
ubuntu-drivers command again to install all recommended drivers:

    $ sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall

Alternatively, install a desired driver selectively using the apt command. 
For example:

    $ sudo apt install nvidia-340

Once the installation is concluded, reboot your system and you are done.
