# Notes:  This test creates 8 100GB files and writes to them simultaneously.
# 
# This is meant for the server so direct=0 is set -- leave caching enabled.
# 
# There is no "stonewall" entry between the 8 job sections, so a job won't 
# wait for the previous job to finish.
# 
# Each job section writes to a different file name.
# 
# time_based  -- this parameter tells the job to run for a certain amount of time, rather than 
# for a set amount of bytes, which simulates long running continuous data loads and how those loads
# might interact with RAM cache on the server.
# 
# runtime -- only works when used with "time_based".  Sets how long jobs will run.
# 
# directory=   -- directory or mount point to run test against, set this for your environment.
