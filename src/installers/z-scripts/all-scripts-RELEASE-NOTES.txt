Notes on the current state of the installer scripts
================================================================================
18 MAY 2014 for v2.1.0

* install-apt-cacher.sh
For 'apt-cacher-ng' to work properly, you need to set a static IP in your 
'hosts' table corresponding to the server that will cache the APT packages; 
this entry should also be present in the 'hosts' file of every (Ubuntu) machine 
on the LAN.  You can edit the 'apt-cacher-ng' script to set this hostname as 
your preferred apt-cacher server name (edit the variable MY_APT_SERVER) so that 
the script will default to using it when you install the service on your server 
and again on each client host on your LAN.

* install-base.sh
Feel free to edit the package list in 'install-base' as you see fit.  It has 
provision for displaying the package sets in (user-defined) categories.  The 
actual list/categories in the file are what's displayed in the 'help' output 
(run with no argument).  The current list is merely my suggestions/favorites.

* install-crossover-deb.sh / install-crossover-bin.sh
Installs CodeWeaver's Crossover, either from a '.bin' package or the newer 
'.deb' package (I suggest the DEB package).  The '.deb' version also installs 
'Wine Launcher Creator'.  Not that the DEB version will not update an older 
Crossover installation that was installed with the '.bin' package version; 
you'll need to uninstall the older one first.  (It will tell you if this is 
the case.)

* install-fwknop.sh
The 'fwknop' script compiles the quasi-latest version of the client and/or 
server from source code.  Note it does not download the latest from 
'http://www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop/download/', but if you wish to update the 
source package, the script is insensitive to the version number in the tarball 
name.

* install-gnome3.sh / install-ppa-gnome3.sh
This script will install the repo version of Gnome 3 (Gnome Shell), whereas the 
'install-ppa-gnome3.sh' script will pull the latest from the developers' PPA.  
For Raring, it's best to install from the repo first (v3.6), then install using 
the PPA version to upgrade to v3.8; Saucy already has 3.8 in its repo.  I've 
yet to try installing 3.10 from the PPA in either distro... Soon.  (And I 
recommend Gnome 3 -- it's a great desktop.)

* install-hosts-files.sh
This script won't work correctly unless you first set a "base" hosts file, 
'/etc/hosts-base', before you run it.  The 'hosts-base' file should contains 
your local static IP assignments, which will be blended with the 'filter' hosts 
list.  

* install-java.sh
The 'java' script will install either v6 or v7 (aka v1.6 or v1.7).  Both will 
enable 'jbidwatcher' to work (as it requires Java to run).

* install-kvm-qemu.sh
This script is "experimental", and I'm still experimenting.  (Have fun if you 
use it, but I suggest playing with this on an otherwise unused machine!  I.e., 
there's no point in installing it in a virtual machine...)

* install-multimedia.sh
Installs VLC, codecs, and multimedia tools.  Run with no parameters to see a 
categorized list of what it will install.  Won't work with Trusty, since they 
removed 'ffmpeg' from the repos; use the PPA version instead.

* install-noip-duc.sh
Users of the No-IP dynamic DNS service need to install a "Dynamic Update 
Client" (DUC) app on at least one system behind each NAT firewall.  This 
script downloads the source for the latest version from No-IP's website, then 
compiles & installs it, and sets it to run at each bootup.

* install-ppa-googledrive.sh
Installs 'google-drive-ocamlfuse', which is a FUSE filesystem backed by Google 
Drive, written in OCaml.  It lets you mount your Google Drive in Linux.  Refer 
to the 'usage' prompt and the author's Git page for details on configuration 
and use.

* install-ppa-googletalk.sh
Adds Google's repository & installs the latest version of the GoogleTalk plugin.  
The Update Manager will find/install updates.  This may be deprecated for using 
"Hangouts" in Google+, but it should still work for making calls directly from 
Gmail.

* install-ppa-grub-customizer.sh
Highly recommend Grub Customizer...  Really ought to be in the main repo.

* install-ppa-linux-kernel.sh
This script is for backporting later kernels into a distro.  It does this by 
downloading requesting kernels that Canonical modifies for Ubuntu from their 
website (or fetching them from local cache, if present).  For example, Raring 
comes with kernel 3.8, but will run with kernels 3.9 and 3.10 -- but not with 
Saucy's kernel, 3.11...

* install-ppa-manager.sh
'Y PPA Manager' is a tool from WebUpd8.org that lets you manage Launchpad PPAs: 
Add, remove, purge PPAs, search for packages in Launchpad PPAs, backup/restore 
PPAs, as well as other useful features.

* install-ppa-multimedia.sh
Installs VLC, codecs, and multimedia tools.  Run with no parameters to see a 
categorized list of what it will install.  Works with Trusty by installing the  
missing 'ffmpeg' package from a PPA.  May work with other distros (untested).

* install-ppa-pidgin
Installs 'pidgin' from the repositories, then adds a PPA-based package that 
implements a compatible indicator for it in Unity.

* install-ppa-pipelight.sh
Pipelight is a special browser plugin which allows one to use Windows-only
plugins inside Linux browsers.  Pipelight currently focuses on Silverlight and
Widevine to allow playing DRM-protected videos.  The project requires a
patched version of Wine to execute the Silverlight DLL.

* install-ppa-rabbitvcs.sh
RabbitVCS works in Precise, but has been broken in every distro since then.  
Pity, as it's a nice look-alike/act-alike for TortoiseSVN.

* install-ppa-skype.sh
Adds Canonical's "Partner" repo to access Microsoft Skype & installs the repo 
version of Skype.  The Update Manager will find/install updates.  Be aware that 
Skype now belongs to Microsoft, and they admit they snoop & give the results 
to the NSA.  (All more than enough reason to skip this and use GoogleTalk or 
Hangouts.)

* install-ppa-ubuntu-tweak.sh
Ubuntu Tweak is another 'System Settings' tool; the Raring & Saucy repos also 
have a Canonical-supported package, "unity tweak tool".  They're not the same 
though, so if you use Unity, you might want to try both & choose your favorite.  
Both seem to beat the installed "System Settings" tool...

* install-ppa-wine.sh / install-wine.sh
Use this if you want to install Wine (which is fine; it pulls in a number of 
packages & fonts).  But either install the repo version or the PPA version; you 
can't install both.  You can safely install Wine, then Crossover, however.

* install-ppa-xorg-edgers.sh / install-ppa-x-updates.sh
The "X-Updates" and "Xorg-Edgers" repos are for obtaining cutting-edge and 
'older release' video card drivers.  "Xorg-Edgers" is more bleeding edge than 
"X-Updates", but the latter often lacks drivers for the last two or three 
distro releases.  (Should find plenty for Precise, though.)  Use with caution, 
and I suggest a backup first that you can roll back from.  (I.e., you ought to 
be using LVM, so take a snapshot, test one of these, and be able to roll back.)  
Pointless to install in a virtual machine...

* install-refind.sh
If you have a UEFI system and want to boot in UEFI mode, you will likely want 
a boot manager, especially if you multi-boot.  This application, made by Rod 
Smith (UEFI Guru) is a nice boot manager that's easy to install & configure, 
and allows simple multibooting, including support for Linux stub loading.

* install-remotebox.sh
This installs a GUI app that allows remote-control of VirtualBox running on 
another host.  It is not necessary to install Vbox to run 'remotebox', but it 
is necessary to install/run a version that is compatible with the server's 
installed version of VirtualBox.  (See the readme file for more info.)  The 
server host must have VBox Webservices running in order to connect.

* install-skype.sh
Installs the latest version of Skype from a '.deb' downloaded from Microsoft's 
website and cached locally.  Will not receive automatic updates.  Be aware that 
Skype now belongs to Microsoft, and they admit they snoop & give the results 
to the NSA.  (All more than enough reason to skip this and use GoogleTalk or 
Hangouts.)

* install-subversion.sh
The subversion script will backport 1.7.x from Quantal if you install it on 
Precise (whose repo uses 1.6.11); otherwise it pulls from the repo.  Raring 
uses 1.7.5; Saucy uses 1.7.9.

* install-vbox-autostart.sh
VirtualBox provides an ability for virtual machines to be automatically
started when a system boots.  This script performs the configuration steps 
needed to set up the service so that users in the VBox Users group, who
have auto-start privileges, can specify which of their VMs they wish
to be started at system boot-up.

* install-vbox-dmi-data.sh
VirtualBox provides the ability to "upload" your PC's DMI data into the VM's DMI 
data area; this is needed if you want your VM to install/activate a so-called 
"Royalty OEM" Windows XP installation.  This script does the uploading for you, 
of either your PC's data (if you have an XP machine and install media) or of a 
canned-in set of data emulating an HP PC.  Unfortunately, this technique fails 
for Dell PCs/install disks.

* install-vbox-webservice.sh
VirtualBox includes a web services API that allows remote-control of the VBox 
Manager.  This script configures and enables this service (which is needed for 
RemoteBox to connect & control VBox).

* install-vim.sh
If you're using EMACS, you should be using VI, and if you're using VI, you 
should be using VIM, and if you're using VIM, you should be using these add-on 
scripts...

* install-virtualbox.sh / install-ppa-virtualbox.sh
For VirtualBox, you can either install the repo version or the version from the 
VirtualBox website; there are two scripts to handle the two cases.  Once 
installed, you can get the corresponding ExtensionPack from the 'virtualbox' 
folder (one level up) to save time downloading from VBox's often slow site.  
I have the corresponding repo version's ExtPack for Precise (4.2.12), Raring 
(4.2.10), and Saucy (4.2.16), plus the latest (4.3.x); the 'last' 4.2 version 
is 4.2.20, which can be downloaded from the VirtualBox website.


Future goal: Make a GUI that lets you pick off a menu of choices, then it 
installs them all without further intervention...
