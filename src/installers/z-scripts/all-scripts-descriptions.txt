README for Ubuntu package installer set
============================================================================
18 MAY 2014 for v2.1.0

These scripts automate the installation of a number of Ubuntu applications 
& packages that are not installed by default in the Ubuntu Desktop Edition, 
are useful to have, yet cannot be installed easily from the Ubuntu Software 
Center. 

The scripts are located in the 'z-scripts' directory.

Package Descriptions:

do-update-all.sh
    Macro to execute 'sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade'.

add-ppa-list.sh
    A short script to automate adding a list of PPA repositories.  The 
    lists are kept in files of the form 'ppa-list.<name>'.

fix-apt.sh
    Checks/fixes the locations of the 'sources.list' files kept in '/etc/apt' 
    so that all third-party source lists are kept in their own files in 
    '/etc/apt/sources.list.d' rather than being incorrectly appended to the 
    '/etc/apt/sources.list' file (which keeps track of the OS lists).

fix-bash.sh
    Edits the '.bashrc' file for one or more accounts to redefine the aliases 
    'l', 'll', and 'la'.  Renames the '.bash_logout' file to inactivate it.
        
fix-ubuntu.sh
    Performs miscellaneous fixups to a freshly-installed system (each of 
    which is queried before being applied).  Some fix-ups need to be run by 
    each user, as they tweak individual account settings.

install-apache.sh
    Installs the Apache Web Server (needed to install Apache Bloodhound).  

install-apt-cacher.sh
    Installs 'apt-cacher-ng', a server application that caches APT packages 
    downloaded from the repositories, making updating other machines faster.

install-base.sh
    Batch installs a large number of useful packages from the repository.
    The packages are listed in the 'usage' prompt.

install-clementine.sh
    Installs the Clementine music player from the Ubuntu repos.

install-crossover-deb.sh / install-crossover-bin.sh
    Installs CodeWeavers CrossOver Linux from a cached installer file.  Also 
    installs additional packages that CrossOver is dependent on (but which 
    CrossOver doesn't install itself).  The '.deb' version also installs 
    Wine Launcher Creator, a utility for adding icons to desktop launchers.

install-fonts.sh
    Installs a set of fonts from cached font files and the repositories.  The
    fonts are listed in the 'usage' prompt.
    
install-fwknop.sh
    Installs the client and/or server portions of the FireWall KNock OPerator 
    suite.  Installation is via compiling source code (to get a significantly 
    newer version) that was previously obtained from the author's website.  
    The server component only needs to be installed on a machine intended to 
    be remotely accessed.

install-gawk.sh
    Installs GNU AWK, which replaces 'mawk' as the default Ubuntu AWK.  If 
    the host is Precise (12.04), it will backport v4.0.1 from a later distro's
    repository, rather than install v3.1.8 from the 12.04 repository.  If 
    you don't write scripts, you likely don't need this and don't care.

install-gedit-plugins.sh
    Installs a set of useful add-on plugins for the 'gedit' text editor.  
    The plugins are listed in the 'usage' prompt.  Note there are two sets of 
    plugins, one for gedit 2.0-3.6, and one for gedit 3.8+.

install-gnome3.sh
    Installs the GNOME Shell (Gnome 3) desktop environment, which becomes an 
    alternative to Unity at the log-in screen.  This install is from the 
    repositories, and includes the tweak tool, themes, and other useful 
    Gnome Shell packages.  If you wish to install the Gnome Team PPA version, 
    install this package first.
    
install-hosts-files.sh
    Installs a hosts file to block ads, banners, third-party cookies, trackers, 
    third-party page counters, web bugs, and most hijackers.  Combines this 
    "blocking" file with a normal hosts file for the system, and automates 
    updating the block list when a new file becomes available.

install-hp15c.sh
    Installs an HP-15C calculator 'simulator', which faithfully replicates 
    the real thing.  A 'must have' for RPN calculator fans.  Installs as a 
    Tcl/Tk application; needs manual creation of a clickable icon.

install-java.sh
    Installs either Java 6 (v1.6.x) or Java 7 (v1.7.x) from the repositories, 
    along with the browser plugin.  Required by JBidWatcher.

install-jbidwatcher.sh
    An Ebay auction sniping program that places a bid for you, in the last 
    minutes or seconds of the auction.  Installs as a Java application; needs 
    manual creation of a clickable icon.  Requires pre-installation of Java 
    (version 6 or 7).

install-kvm-qemu.sh
    Installs the Kernel Virtual Machine & QEMU package set, plus all the KVM 
    'suggested' packages.
    
install-mawk.sh
    Installs the latest version of Michael's AWK, invoked as 'mawk'; it does 
    not replace mawk v1.3.3 as the default Ubuntu AWK.  Installation is by 
    downloading and compiling source code from the author's website.  If 
    you don't write scripts, you likely don't need this and don't care.

install-multimedia.sh
    Installs multi-media codecs, streaming audio/video libraries, VLC (app & 
    plugin), Flash plugin, and other multi-media support.  'Trusty' requires 
    the PPA version (due to the deletion of a key package in the repos).

install-noip-duc.sh
    Users of the No-IP dynamic DNS service need to install a "Dynamic Update 
    Client" (DUC) app on at least one system behind each NAT firewall.  This 
    script install's No-IP's DUC and sets it to run at each bootup.

install-perf-test.sh
    Installs packages for running system performance/tuning applications.  
    (Currently, 'glxgears' and 'glxspheres' for video performance testing.)

install-postgres.sh
    Installs the PostgreSQL database from the repository.  Needed for Apache 
    Bloodhound.

install-ppa-audio-recorder.sh
    Installs a useful app to record "anything that plays out your speakers".

install-ppa-banshee.sh
    Installs the latest version of Banshee from the author's PPA, along with 
    useful extensions.  (The repo version is usually way out of date.)

    clipboard sync (primary selection and Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V clipboard), and an 
    option to set the clipboard size.

install-ppa-dropbox.sh
    Installs Dropbox from Dropbox's repository, and prints out some useful 
    text to describe the rest of Dropbox's (complex) installation process.
    Note that once installed, Dropbox will be updated via Update Manager.

install-ppa-gnome3.sh
    Installs the latest version of the GNOME Shell (Gnome 3) desktop 
    environment, which becomes an alternative to Unity at the log-in screen.  
    This install is from the Gnome Team PPA, and includes the tweak tool, 
    themes, and other useful Gnome Shell packages.  Although not required, 
    you may get the best results by installing the repo package first.

install-ppa-googledrive.sh
    Installs 'google-drive-ocamlfuse', which is a FUSE filesystem backed by 
    Google Drive, written in OCaml.  It lets you mount your Google Drive in 
    Linux.

install-ppa-googletalk.sh
    Installs the GoogleTalk plugin from Google's repository.  Note that 
    once installed, GoogleTalk will be updated via Update Manager.  (Also, 
    GoogleTalk has been superceded by Google+ Hangouts, but still works.)

    Installs an excellent GUI application for controlling & customizing GRUB, 
    including full support for multi-booting other OSes and boot-time tools.

    well as other useful features.

install-ppa-multimedia.sh
    Installs multi-media codecs, streaming audio/video libraries, VLC (app &

install-ppa-pidgin.sh
    This script installs Pidgin, then installs a PPA-based indicator for Pidgin.

install-ppa-pipelight.sh
    Pipelight is a special browser plugin which allows one to use Windows-only
    plugins inside Linux browsers.  Pipelight currently focuses on Silverlight 
    and its features, such as playing DRM-protected videos.

install-ppa-rabbitvcs.sh
    Installs the latest version of RabbitVCS, a Linux equivalent of Windows' 
    TortoiseSVN, from the author's PPA.  (The repo version is usually way out 
    of date.)  Requires pre-installation of Subversion.

install-ppa-skype.sh
    Installs Microsoft Skype for Linux from Ubuntu's 'partner' repository, and 
    adds the needed 32-bit library support for 64-bit hosts.  Not recommended; 
    consider using Google+ Hangouts, GoogleTalk, or Ekiga instead.

install-ppa-ubuntu-tweak.sh

    from local folders or using downloads from online sources.
    
install-ppa-virtualbox.sh

    Note that once installed, this version will be updated via Update Manager,

    Extensions Pack (if installed, as recommended) and re-installing the 
    Guest Additions in each virtual machine.

    extended weather forecast by clicking the 'Forecast' option in its menu.

    updates for video card drivers.  (Usually does not provide drivers for 
    the latest Ubuntu version.)

install-refind.sh
    rEFInd is a UEFI boot manager.  rEFInd can auto-detect your installed EFI 
    boot loaders, and it presents a nice GUI menu of boot options that allows 
    booting GPT drives, legacy MBR drives, CD/DVDs (in UEFI or BIOS modes),

    Webservices running.

install-skype.sh
    Installs Microsoft Skype for Linux from a cached '.deb' file, and adds the 
    needed 32-bit library support for 64-bit hosts.  Not recommended; consider 
    using Google+ Hangouts, GoogleTalk, or Ekiga instead.

install-subversion.sh
    Installs the Subversion version control system.  If the host is Precise 
    (12.04), it will backport SVN from a later distro's repository; this is 
    in order to install v1.7 (or later), avoiding the problems with multiple 
    '.svn' folders.  Note that to also install the Apache Web Server, it will 
    be necessary to use the accompanying install script to prevent a library 
    dependency issue.

install-vbox-autostart.sh
    VirtualBox provides an ability for virtual machines to be automatically
    started when a system boots.  This script performs the configuration steps 
    needed to set up the system for auto-starting virtual machines.

    canned-in set of data emulating an HP PC.
    
install-vbox-webservice.sh
    Configures a VirtualBox host to run the VBox Web Services.  This allows 
    a client PC (running, e.g., RemoteBox) to control VBox running on the 
    server, including configuring it and starting/stopping guest VMs.

install-vim.sh
    Installs both 'vim' and 'gvim', plus useful vim scripts.  This replaces 
    'vi' as the default vi editor.  The scripts are listed in the 'usage' 
    prompt.

    Installs the OSE version of VirtualBox from the Ubuntu repositories.  This 
    version is considered 'stable' and does not receive updates.

install-wine.sh
    Installs the current stable version of Wine from the repositories.
