Installing PlantUML
----------------------------------

You need these things to run PlantUML:

*  Java     - https://www.java.com/en/download/ or install from your Linux repo
*  Graphviz - https://www.graphviz.org/         or install from your Linux repo

   Graphviz (short for Graph Visualization Software) is a package of open-source 
   tools initiated by AT&T Labs Research for drawing graphs specified in DOT 
   language scripts.  It also provides libraries for software applications to 
   use the tools.  Graphviz is free software licensed under the Eclipse Public 
   License.
   
   Graphviz is optional if you only need sequence diagrams & activity (beta) 
   diagrams.  PlantUML should be working with any version of Graphviz, starting 
   with v2.26.3.  The following versions have been tested and are known to work:
      2.26.3
      2.28
      2.30.1
      2.34
      2.36
      2.38
      
   If you compile Graphviz by yourself, you have to build it with 'libexpat' in 
   order to work with PlantUML.  By default, the dot executable should be:

   Windows:
      * Firstly in: 'C:\Program Files\Graphviz*\bin\dot.exe'
      * Then in: 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Graphviz*\bin\dot.exe'
      
   On Linux/Mac OS-X:
      * Firstly in: '/usr/local/bin/dot'
      * Then in: '/usr/bin/dot'
      * You can also specify the environment variable GRAPHVIZ_DOT to set the 
        exact location of your GraphViz executable.
      
Installed the above?  Then simply download "plantuml.jar" and run it to open 
PlantUML's graphical user interface.  There is no need to unpack or install 
anything.  To have information about where PlantUML expects to find 'dot', you 
can use the command line:

   $ java -jar plantuml.jar -testdot

You can also use this special diagram description in file "testdot.txt":

   @startuml
   testdot
   @enduml

then run

   $ java -jar plantuml.jar testdot.txt


Version Checking
----------------------------------

If you want to know the exact version of PlantUML you are using, you can type 
in the command line:

   $ java -jar plantuml.jar -version

or use the following small special diagram description in "version.txt":

   @startuml
   version
   @enduml

To check if a newer version is available, you can use the command line:

   $ java -jar plantuml.jar -checkversion	
   
This command connects to the PlantUML website, so you may have to set a proxy:
(Please note that -D flags must be set before -jar flag.)

   $ java -Dhttp.proxyHost=myproxy.com -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080 \
     -jar plantuml.jar -checkversion	

Or use the following small special diagram description in "check.txt":

   @startuml
   checkversion
   @enduml

You can also set your proxy using the following syntax in "check.txt":

   @startuml
   checkversion(proxy=myproxy.com,port=8080)
   @enduml


Other Issues
----------------------------------

If you have a message "file not found" when running the Word Macro with Java 7,
you may have to properly set Environment Variables.  To fix, go into Windows 
Environment Variables settings and find/create these two variables:

   Variable Name: PATH, Add to Value: ";C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin"
   Variable Name: CLASSPATH, Add to Value: ";C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\lib"


If you are running PlantUML on a Linux server without graphical capability, 
you can turn PlantUML to headless mode, using a flag:

   $ java -Djava.awt.headless=true -jar /data/PlantUml/plantuml.jar ...
