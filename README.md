# installer_scripts
Set of scripts for installing & configuring software (Linux & Windows packages)

I have a (64GB) thumb drive full of cached Windows and (Ubuntu) Linux application installers, plus a set of scripts to automate downloading them (if not already cached) and installing them.  It handles installing `.deb`, `.tgz`, & `.zip` package files, installing from Ubuntu repositories or PPAs, running shell scripts, compiling from source, etc. -- in all cases, presenting a uniform CLI interface and effectively hiding _how_ the packages are installed.

I've been asked if I could put this on GitHub...  Well, yes & no.  I can put the scripts & documentation I wrote here, but the bulk of the thumb drive is proprietary or copyrighted software installation packages (to have something cached in the case where they're not accessible via the Internet).

So this is currently a compromise: I've replicated the structure of the thumb drive, with placeholders for packages I can't include here.  One could (in theory at least) reconstruct my thumb drive from this listing, by downloading the proprietary & copyrighted software installation packages to add to what's in this repo.
